# Superstartup Library

Superstartup is a Javascript library for the browser. It provides modules that enable a startup to get up and running fast. It does so by providing a robust, flexible and well tested solution for these high level tasks:

* **User Module**. External authentications (FB, Twitter, oAuth2...), User Data Object (udo) management, query for users, manage profile or any other functionality using plugins.
* **Metrics**. Intelligent set of abstractions that help penetrate on visitors' behavior, conversions, regency and any small or big metric that needs to be measured.
* **Social Tools**. Sharing widgets, mechanisms and integrations for all the major social networks, wired to the metrics libraries for a crystal clear view on what is happening and where it happens in your site.

Built to be framework and server API agnostic, Superstartup will integrate seamlessly with any technology stack you may have.
