# Super Startup Library

Superstartup is a Javascript library that helps startups skip the trivial [or not] tasks of building a user system, doing metrics properly and rediscovering the wheel each time.

Build to be framework and server API agnostic, superstartup will integrate seamlessly with any technology stack you may have. 

## Status

Still under heavy development, designing the API, deep wiring and grinding. A great time to pop in and help steer the project. 

In the meantime please check the libraries that sprang out and are the foundations of Superstartup:

* **[server.js](https://github.com/thanpolas/server2js)** Transfer data objects from server to javascript on page load.
* **[Grunt Closure Tools](https://github.com/thanpolas/grunt-closure-tools)** [Google Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/) DepsWriter, Builder and Compiler tasks for grunt.
* **[Google Closure Library Boilerpate](https://github.com/thanpolas/closure-boilerplate)** The Google Closure Library boilerplate. Checkout, start working.


## Technology Stack

Superstartup is being developed using the Google Closure Library, achieving maximum performance, extensibility and the smallest possible size a library could ever hope for.
