The superstartup Framework is a ready to go framework for new Internet Startups. 

Built on top of Code Igniter and Google Closure Library, it provides an out of the box solution for user registration and management via Facebook or Twitter, metrics facilities and deployment tools.

Gives a kickstart to any hackathon team wanting to plainly work on their idea instead of having to built the same facilities again and again.
