INITIAL WORKSPACE SETUP
----------------------------

Google Closure Library
Google closure library must be downloaded in the folder: html/js/closure-library
So add this folder to your .gitignore 
We may use a git mirror of the library if we don't want to svn the library

cd html/js
mkdir closure-library
cd closure-library
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/jarib/google-closure-library.git
git fetch origin
git pull origin master
