INITIAL WORKSPACE SETUP
----------------------------

Let's get crazy with git!
First fork the superstartup repo on Github
https://github.com/thanpolas/superstartup

Now create your local folder, enter it and:
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB/superstartup.git
git remote add upstream git@github.com:thanpolas/superstartup.git

Download your forked repo to local:
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/master
git checkout -b master

You should now have a copy of superstartup sources in your local folder. We are not done yet, we have two major packages we need to get, CodeIgniter and Google's Closure Library. We have added them as submodules so you need to fetch them:
git submodule init
git submodule update


Get into the superstartup directory and initialize the submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update

Let's get crazy with git now

Setup your apache to have superstartup/html as DocumentRoot
