INITIAL WORKSPACE SETUP
----------------------------

Let's get crazy with git!
First fork the superstartup repo on Github
https://github.com/thanpolas/superstartup

Now create your local copy:
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB/superstartup.git

If you want to stay up to date with the latest update add the superstartup repo as your upstream:
git remote add upstream git@github.com:thanpolas/superstartup.git

We are not done yet, we have two major packages we need to get, CodeIgniter and Google's Closure Library. We have added them as submodules so you need to fetch them:
git submodule init
git submodule update

Setup your apache to have superstartup/html as DocumentRoot

Create and edit configuration files:
cd engine/CI/application/config
ls -l tpl_*

You will see all the files you need to copy omitting the 'tpl_' prefix and edit them.
